        <h2>Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The pattern is created in Photoshop, either from a sketch or a commission idea.</li>
          <li>I then choose the perfect glass for the project, there are many different types of glass, some are plain translucent coloured glass, wispy, there are many textured glass sheets such as water glass, there is completely opaque and some incredible opalescent and iridised glass also!</li>
          <li>The pattern is then printed, and transferred onto the glass pieces.</li>
          <li>The glass is scored along the pattern and snapped with special pliers to follow the lines of the template.</li>
          <li>The glass edges are grinded and smoothed.</li>
          <li>The edges are then wrapped in a copper foil and burnished over the glass so that solder will run along the edges, attaching the glass pieces together.</li>
          <li>The piece is then carefully soldered together, cleaned up and polished, and done!</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Aimee, thank you so much for visiting Birch Glass!<br>
        Based in Staffordshire, UK I make each piece with love and am totally obsessed with the entire process. I begun creating stained glass pieces in November 2020 and am absolutely loving it.<br>
        I handmake glass creations through the process of copper foiled stained glass. Each piece is designed, hand cut, foiled and then soldered together to create unique suncatchers and more.
        <br>If you have any questions at all please feel free to reach out at my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BirchGlassUK/" target="_blank">Birch Glass</a> facebook page anytime and I'd be happy to help.<br><br>
        Thanks again!<br>
        Aimee</p>
